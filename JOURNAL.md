## 10/19/2025 - master sketches  

Started this project a few weeks back. I decided to create a 3d printer aimed at printing as fast as possible without losing quality. 
Specs:
- ~250^3 build area
- AWD for high accels and better speed
- All metal gantry (can mill/waterjet at school) 
- tri-point bed leveling
- Lead screw Z

inspirations:
- Voron trident
- Ratrigs vc3/4
- Monolith gantry

Master sketch for the gantry and frame

Variables to control frame size and offsets. Should allow me to quickly change the frame without digging through cad.
